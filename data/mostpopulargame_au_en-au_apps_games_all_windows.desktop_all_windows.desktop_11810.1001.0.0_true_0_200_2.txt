This is an excellent family story with a paranormal twist!\r\n\r\nYour family’s past is more interesting than any story. And it's not over yet...\r\n \r\nOne of my father’s stories was my favorite: “Once upon a time there lived a merchant with his wife. The family was happy and had never known grief. However, their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual … although there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his beloved wife from her cursed world.”\r\n\r\nYears have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: “Your favorite fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is waiting in our old family home.”\r\n\r\nAs a son, I must “write” the happy ending for my family’s story.\r\n\r\nThis puzzle adventure is perfect for playing while traveling.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHWFH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Halo: Spartan Assault","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41242.9007199266246750.b5f0c5ca-5ab3-404b-912d-678a81bc026a.6ee06dac-cc5a-4046-926a-8d24f5d12f09","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4493.9007199266246750.feb5e230-f066-46e7-b1b0-334703e1dca9.4e70e1db-5c65-407c-9341-541db70832cf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$4.45","Price":4.45,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"165","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.HaloSpartanAssault_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["4f99406a-6a90-9925-c57a-a0ac9afd8a26","db563263-0404-cc41-3570-f3008f64def9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Halo: Spartan Assault brings the excitement of Halo combat to touch-based devices for the very first time.

Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she's going to return home. The young woman encounters a civilization similar to the Mayan culture, but this is neither the past nor a parallel reality. It's another planet, connected to Earth centuries ago by some special gates. And now the gates have been activated again...\r\n\r\nOnly Shaash, the local shaman and gate keeper, can help Diana return home. But that will not be easy. Diana will have to face numerous tests, travel far through the Endless River Valley, encountering the strange people and wondrous animals of the other world, while trying to hide from all dangers and solving dozens of different challenges on her way.\r\n\r\n- Multiple wonderful locations and stunning graphics\r\n- Unexpected plot turns\r\n- Unforgettable characters\r\n- Fascinating mini-games and

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5XN7G","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Amazing Breakout Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30302.13510798886397479.fd4a022f-1e11-422b-8c2b-d04ea8c63f54.fddba406-4852-42df-a6fd-deea16c6cd7f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3696.13510798886397479.52ebb172-4ad0-4998-ac9c-025ff8b37285.2d11f56e-29b5-4bb5-8e1b-9d86c6a5e2b5","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14149.13510798886397479.606692e1-0005-45eb-8123-40f6cf99e21d.f5307453-cef3-4b06-b62a-59adf35f5b2d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30024.13510798886397479.4e5f201b-42ab-4876-bb38-8bda6849ddb2.0751a107-ecab-4b40-beca-91577f81f0c9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"13","PackageFamilyNames":["Trapped.AmazingBreakoutGame_bhn6e84ggqs1p"],"ContentIds":["fa44ff97-656e-4a6a-4867-d5bccd3784cd","6ad4cb36-5a41-24d2-da52-d1c823b987bd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Locked in a Museum - you'd better escape before you become an exhibit yourself...\r\nYou've decided that evening is a great time to visit a museum.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference.

Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PM4G6NFR3DM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hearts Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5327.14305138429995512.f62a8e7d-91bd-4364-8623-ca90dda4c70a.930637bc-5b15-44e6-a839-bfab9434cb93","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22059.14305138429995512.f62a8e7d-91bd-4364-8623-ca90dda4c70a.f944e522-bc53-47c6-b899-7576d3989acd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["37936Larocque.HeartsClassic_kgerrer9nxtm4"],"ContentIds":["eb53429b-48de-215a-cacf-23c8974d25ce","0c605085-d866-7ab4-5cf5-8e2128db90e6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The classic card game Hearts is now available on the Windows Store.

Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJXXC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cribbage","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40243.9007199266268820.9fed455a-f7f5-46e7-8b95-7756ac9e67ef.13a3725d-0706-4bec-b6a5-2d7efccf9f7e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4002.9007199266268820.0e814b30-6734-4319-8ffd-cce7666f5c82.9058c3af-4606-4c83-afc1-f4d6d6011cc3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$4.45","Price":4.45,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["TrivialTechnology.Cribbage_0ynvawc60ma20"],"ContentIds":["2f1f22ba-b2c8-5caf-888f-e1218f2785ca"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play the card game that’s been challenging humans for over 400 years, now re-imagined for Windows 8!

They prosper and reach their milestones that way. One heroic hamster tired of idleness decided there is more to life and idle than just that. Instead of going through the idle games routine of an ordinary rodent, he tapped and gathered like-minded hamsters for a trip of their lifetimes to reach his milestones - gather energy riches. He took some picks and built a high-tech spaceship powered by his tapped click wheel and prepared for a journey to explore the vast riches of the outer space void. All he needs before the takeoff to the void is your click.\r\n\r\nYour duty and milestones in this incremental game are to make sure that the brave heroic hamster picks do not revert to his idling ways and the eager astronaut would prosper by tapping him or his wheel with power click encouraging him to generate energy riches milestones and delve ever deeper into unexplored universe void. \r\n\r\nIn Hamster Universe like in idle games you have to spend the click generated energy for items of clothing appropriate for a heroic space voyager this eager hamster is (after all, you don’t want the first space hamster traveling dressed in some old rags, do you?). While the amount of tapped energy the astronaut hamster can generate by running is truly astounding, you can add to it by spending a part of the energy yield on alternate sources of picks which will keep the energy flowing even when the eager hamster picks are resting. If you want to generate even more, the hamster will always have some rewarding tasks and milestones to do. Fulfill them and you shall see the energy level riches skyrocket and your little astronaut hamster prosper.\r\n\r\nThe thought of idleness flying through the incremental / idle space with nothing but void around makes you feel uncomfortable? Don't worry! You shall not be joining a crew of a single spaceship. In fact, your eager tapped friend picks a whole fleet of heroic hamster-piloted spacecraft in support!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Idle games / Incremental gameplay is easy to understand for everyone!

Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Sight Words is a delightful app across the board for children, parents and teachers!\r\n\r\nJoin Tammy the frog on a journey through four exciting activities as she hops from one activity to the next to learn and review commonly used English words from the list of 220 Dolch sight words. There are five levels of vocabulary for the child to learn and review.\r\nIn Kids Sight Words, children will: \r\n- listen to common words and identify the correct sight word\r\n- learn to recognize common words at their reading level\r\n- improve reading skills by practicing words that they may have seen or are familiar with\r\n- improve reading fluency\r\nKids Sight Words is the newest addition to our dynamic collection of English apps. It is for children who are already comfortable with the basics of phonics and blending sounds. If your children are not at this level yet, we recommend downloading Intellijoy apps such as, Kids ABC Letters, Kids ABC Trains, Kids ABC Phonics, and Kids Reading apps.\r\nIntellijoy's educational games delight children through fun and learning. Children and parents love our distraction-free games. All of the apps focus on specific learning concepts. They do not distract the users with unnecessary sounds or images on the screen, not to mention ads, pop-ups, and unrelated subject matter.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZP3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Numbers and Math","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61895.9007199266294594.370a946b-5e8f-4a08-991c-d4f501dd6c07.501b37fd-71ff-4d2f-b695-448c1879c951","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61279.9007199266294594.2b14e36f-07b0-466a-b46d-749e87f4f8fc.25dae9c0-ac4e-496c-97ce-a2761a57b56b","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33285.9007199266294594.7f884f3a-bf8d-499e-bb00-190bf21c0cc2.d602d8ef-1f75-4dc1-9e65-135cb430f075","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40704.9007199266294594.c880774f-117d-4cce-a7f4-a7b43f5d6703.7b57005a-fb96-41a0-baff-c2d53508500e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$4.45","Price":4.45,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsMathSkillsActivities_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["72303023-21f3-9397-0835-06881bc84463","32602157-23b5-3ed8-4cc2-d6a787498afa","e41c7505-f93d-c60c-5086-ac23f9d6495d","6230c18b-fefc-5de1-3b0a-1d471dbf5885"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Help your preschool and early elementary school children learn their numbers and master basic arithmetic skills with Kids Numbers and Math.\r\n\r\n(The paid version enables the number ranges to be set).\r\n\r\nKids will learn to: \r\n✔ Name numbers \r\n✔ Count \r\n✔ Compare numbers \r\n✔ Add \r\n✔ Subtract \r\n✔ Match numbers\r\n\r\nThis package of brightly designed, pleasantly narrated number recognition and math games is made with little hands and budding mathematicians in mind.\r\n\r\nWith its large, easily readable numbers and a bright, simple color palette, Kids Numbers and Math promises to keep your child's attention with kid-friendly backgrounds including hot air balloons, orchards, and an old-fashioned black board.\r\n\r\nA pleasant-sounding teacher guides, encourages, and congratulates the children as they progress through the activities. A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH67S31","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Chinese Chess#","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33742.13510798886642532.e76d7e19-e985-45b5-af41-f7a8272afcef.d2a5e83c-0f9a-40e7-a0ec-6a148b27337a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#994c00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["9705HomeLimited.ChineseChess_1yc9tfjnd2w24"],"ContentIds":["4ba119a9-37a8-ff7e-5f58-6cf489717550"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A Chinese chess game (also called Xiangqi).\r\n\r\nSmart AI with 3 levels:Beginner,Medium,Master!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ2TK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dragon's Blade II FX","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39149.9007199266245968.f305124d-e43a-411d-b6ce-f02a471ede41.215d7cb3-cb31-4d87-bcd5-f5fafc0bd75e","Height":200,"Width":200,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33387.9007199266245968.04fe92e0-a46e-4af4-bc6a-e6ba7eec1151.2fbc7bdf-5091-4b20-9f7a-8aee9fd7e1c3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44215.9007199266245968.186927ed-ac5b-4642-a250-542a868397f7.e9519f55-7df6-442c-886d-d4036f6bd959","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10408.9007199266245968.38c43961-39d7-4020-9a30-1773deddab19.c0e995c2-c100-4612-8a4b-3b3728362fa8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62224.9007199266245968.e1f6f77f-a333-4ffe-83a4-aef8b001fe8d.d2b20e09-0a74-4a1d-a8de-2980c692d995","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24165.9007199266245968.8d0e0e7d-2bff-4211-a85e-7666c8e4290d.e3815a0c-30b5-4842-bf24-b2ea301a862d","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"140","PackageFamilyNames":["NateMonsterLLC.DragonsBladeIIFX_1v1304hp7jwzg"],"ContentIds":["e87370ff-38f5-0c52-08d1-7beec2d6d86c","524f8c9a-f13c-0791-874b-096a82b6ec73","b1678219-f670-2eaa-3a4d-91102ac77e11","096b2331-a554-9e9c-ee20-20ba4976adcd","66a863e1-297c-6e20-fdf2-595322fa90a0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Return to the golden age of turn-based RPG gaming in this instant classic, exclusively for Windows.
