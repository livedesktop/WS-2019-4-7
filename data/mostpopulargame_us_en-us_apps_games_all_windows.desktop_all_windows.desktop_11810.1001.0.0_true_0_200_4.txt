You can either play the easy Draw 1 games where most games are winnable, or if you feel up-to the challenge, try your luck with Draw 3 and Vegas play modes.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy adding a personal touch to your game, customize the backdrop and card backs with photos from your own photo library for unlimited personalization possibilities. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n+ Draw 1 card (Easy) \r\n+ Draw 3 cards (Hard) \r\n+ 10 Kinds of App Backgrounds \r\n+ 14 Kinds of Card Backgrounds \r\n+ Crisp, beautiful, and easy to read cards \r\n+ Portrait or landscape \r\n+ Efficient, fast, and sensible game interface \r\n+ Single tap to place a card or drag and drop \r\n+ Standard Klondike scoring \r\n+ Smart hints show potentially useful moves \r\n+ Custom backdrops & cards from your photos \r\n+ Timer, moves, and statistics \r\n+ Unlimited Undos \r\n+ Auto-Complete option to finish a solved game \r\n+ Fun & challenging achievements \r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N9HB2FNCZ5B","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sephirothic Stories","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40127.13537047581955515.0b88e678-afd3-4ca5-915d-6533c3a0a7df.5c8f3c4c-966a-42e5-b394-73dfa8b02959","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12733.13537047581955515.0b88e678-afd3-4ca5-915d-6533c3a0a7df.c2f09d17-e315-4793-94de-4e801866eaa1","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62673.13537047581955515.0b88e678-afd3-4ca5-915d-6533c3a0a7df.7dfd5153-89e8-400b-9c81-c70d6a2f639a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57073.13537047581955515.0b88e678-afd3-4ca5-915d-6533c3a0a7df.673883f6-bc37-44df-831d-a69f3185e055","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18494.13537047581955515.0b88e678-afd3-4ca5-915d-6533c3a0a7df.512d984b-2359-4bb9-be45-cb1f4c0a2f9d","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46539.13537047581955515.0b88e678-afd3-4ca5-915d-6533c3a0a7df.d9e1ace0-22d1-4b11-8b29-1bc6788e9647","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$14.99⁺","Price":14.99,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["KEMCO.SephirothicStories_f2bp5vqmgh7cp"],"ContentIds":["f8b93930-664b-3fff-df29-bfc9fbb84193","4affd7c0-9676-f83a-59bc-cab37841cc2e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Shendoah―a world protected by Sephiroth.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4047T","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Faces of Illusion: The Twin Phantoms","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7860.13510798887960764.f1962961-a6bc-47ea-8341-5ffefc02abe3.dd2ffb4a-e8d3-44c1-af8a-cf3263d65bd2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"198","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.FacesofIllusionTheTwinPhantoms_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["b6d08b8f-8179-a67f-3696-6fa29dba57fd","f28d8818-36a8-5de1-e8ae-af353e6f9a55","7b837590-8b29-133c-0e2a-0b61302e8c2e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nEmbark on an exciting adventure between magic and illusion.

Secret of Serpent Creek is an original hidden-object puzzle-adventure game, featuring a totally unique Detective Mode. This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode!

types of businesses: Cars, rockets, phones, tanks, trucks, airplanes, computers, and ships. Design, produce, market and sell them. You can even run multiple companies at the same time.\r\n\r\nStart by creating a company: First, choose what to produce. For example, you can design cars (combustion engine based, electric, hybrid), then produce, market and sell them. Other types of products are trucks, phones, computers, ships, airplanes, tanks and even rockets. Once you are successful, you can even start more companies, and run them at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet market demands, you need to design your products so that customers will actually want them, and won't prefer to buy your competitors products. Research new technologies and design new products as your move on to fit into a moving market. For example for cars, you want to research bigger and more efficient batteries, if you decide to produce electric cars, or more performant combustion engines if you want to produce gasoline or diesel based cars.\r\n\r\nThe game is running in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time. Manage employees, track financial and sales data, start and run marketing campaigns, analyze the market. Expand your company when you have figured out how everything works and manage the production plan and build new facilities, warehouses, offices or even launch pads.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3TN71","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"9 Clues 2: The Ward","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28718.13510798884694988.3a3681b9-c06f-49e0-a106-9314cffdb1b5.bf016bec-51f3-44ef-9fd4-c5fa7cce802c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"265","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.9Clues2TheWard_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["47d795ce-c090-cfa2-4ca6-ea4455a906e0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nTwo detectives respond to a distressing call from a rainy island housing an insane asylum.

The game is played with a standard deck of cards (including 2 jokers). \r\n\r\nPlayers are dealt a total of 12 cards.  The remaining 6 cards are dealt face down into the 'Kitty'.  Each player will bid starting clockwise from the dealer (dealer bids last).  \r\nThe bid consists of a bid number and description.  The bid number is the number of tricks (books) a player believes his partnership can achieve over 6. For example, a bid of 4 = 10 books. \r\n\r\nThe bid description indicates a bid direction (High or Low) or whether the bid is a 'No' trump. A bid direction of High (Uptown) indicates A,K,Q... are the highest value cards. A bid direction of Low (Downtown, Special) indicates A,2,3... are the highest value cards. A 'No' trump bid indicates that each suit has equal weight and the lead card can not be 'cut'.  The bid direction of a 'No' bid is specified after winning the bid.\r\nBid numbers can range from 3 - 7.  The Option screen gives the player the option of playing with a minimum of 3 or 4.\r\nBid descriptions have the following weights:  'No' > 'Low' > 'High'.  The Option screen allows the player to play make 'Low' and 'High' equal in weight: 'No' > 'Low' = 'High'. \r\n\r\nThe highest bidder indicates a 'trump' suit or in the case of a 'No' bid indicates the direction (High/Low).  The jokers become the highest value cards in the indicated 'trump' suit.  For example, if Diamonds were called as 'trump' the highest value cards for a 'High' direction would be:  Big Joker, Little Joker, A, K,...  In the case of a 'No' bid, the Big Joker and Little Joker have no value and should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bid winner will start play as the lead player.  The remaining players must play a card in the same suit as the lead card if available. If the player does not have a card in that suit they may play another suit. The highest value card in the lead suit wins the sequence unless a trump card is played in which case the highest trump card wins the sequence. The winner of the sequence will be the lead player in the following sequence. \r\n\r\nGame Options\r\n\r\nPractice Mode:  The computer will not bid.  Allowing the player to always win bid and practice different plays.\r\nScoring - Conventional and Progressive:  With Conventional scoring the bid winner may go into negatives if the bid is not acheived.

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money.

As you may know, most Solitaire games are not winnable, despite playing your best. We decided to fix that and provide you with the best game experience. We included in this game only winnable deals for both types of games: games in which you draw one card, and games in which you draw 3 cards. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly.\r\nDownload and play now! \r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ 100.000+ Solvable deals \r\n✓ Draw 1 or Draw 3 cards option\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Easy to use \r\n✓ High quality graphics\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ In this game you have to build up 4 stacks of cards of the same suit in each of the 4 foundation piles from the top of the screen. Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n✓ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n✓ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the game. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n✓ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

You’ve just found the most original coin dozer casino simulator that blends perfectly with your world explorer and treasure hunting games taste! Our unique arcade provides not only the classic coin dropper gameplay, but it mixes it with a treasure hunt for giving you a unique coin dozer experience in different level locations like: Treasure Cave, Gold of Ra, Diamond Rock & Temple of Venus!\r\n\r\nThe infamous red-bearded pirate left behind his treasure maps!  It seems like your luck already started changing because now, you have all the treasures locations. Begin your treasure hunt quest now, to collect all the coins & prizes of the huge lots inside the chests. Be careful though; the red-bearded pirate left some traps & fake treasure chests to keep safe his gold coins & jewels. The traps can cause that most of the coins and goodies fall to the sides of the dozer machine; so be really careful when you tap!\r\n\r\n💰🔦💰 Let the treasures chase & the coin dash dozer fun action begins! Download NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest and enjoy the tons of prizes & high winning rates! 💰🔦💰\r\n\r\nNot familiar with Coin Dozer free games rules? No problem! It works almost the same like the real coin pusher games machines, and you’ll see a short video tutorial. Tap the pusher to make coins drop on it. All the coins or prizes that fall on the sides won’t be counted on your balance. The main goal is to drop coins & have them pushing over the front edge of the platforms. Our game includes incredible boosters that will help you on your cash collect quest. Check every booster special power & actions in the help section to build your winner strategy! Use the power ups wisely, as some of them don’t regenerate so fast as others. Gain XP points to increase your experience bar and unlock more maps and game levels. Our dozer can compete with the best prize claw machines or simulators in rewards matter; but unlike the claw machine, your chances of winning are much higher!\r\n\r\n🎊💀🎊 Collect all the special items like gold bars or secret boxes to conquer all the secret rewards hidden among the chests treasures! Try NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest FREE for limited time only! 🎊💀🎊\r\n\r\nIf you get stuck, use the Shake option; every collected coin fills your Shake meter. You can activate it when it reaches one of the three levels: Low, Medium or High. Activating this feature shakes the table making the coins on the edge fall off the table. Collect 4 or more coins at once to trigger a Coin Attack; this will create and spread special goodies, prizes and puzzle pieces. Once you collect all the gold puzzle pieces, 12 to be exact, you’ll open the secret door of the room which contains a huge amount of rewards. Puzzle mini games unlock at level 5, and from there each level of our dozer has a puzzle mini-game to solve. Keep gaining XP to collect all the surprise rewards waiting for you!\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH532KX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Blue Angels: Ready, Break!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33149.13510798887681309.e5952556-e9fc-4b69-bb9d-5557b90ced3a.76d84e53-096f-49aa-afa2-296bc591f3db","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9932.13510798887681309.8e5c6423-a660-472f-9d3e-409ecc38df77.f3d71956-13e1-4a36-8924-d65b57763567","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4048.13510798887681309.d06d1398-2409-4093-bc4d-992cb5163fd4.d081bd99-dbb5-4f61-b1a2-3f01d882030b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23939.13510798887681309.642ef68d-3fbb-4fd5-88f9-c103f80af19b.183ff42d-0268-4999-a5dc-b117ec460387","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28928.13510798887681309.058157c3-1c79-4261-84f1-885514cc7364.0fb1c728-3af3-4f0a-8c1b-aa3341a997e7","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12252.13510798887681309.03e96dfb-fb1e-4972-a0cc-c08b68b7edbb.5711a6cc-4a8b-47e7-b57a-1593ee5d7108","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11400.13510798887681309.951d0f46-d993-4223-b82b-f1da3551d97b.1ffa2dc8-4c11-4a89-bfd7-f2b227bbc06e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19721.13510798887681309.c7a18834-648d-4237-861f-ad78f0a7b1cf.44c9d12a-04f7-41a6-bf17-2c2ed3240070","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27117.13510798887681309.5ea01694-ef09-4437-9833-07aa51a6b7f6.47c32000-5fc5-436b-8c4b-8eb3ededf47e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58891.13510798887681309.b5265bf6-722d-4e6b-8fe2-80a182e9505a.09a40209-9e2a-4445-9266-6bf2b8103ce9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["RORTOS.BlueAngels-AerobaticFlightSimulator_bdr6sknkj2vj2"],"ContentIds":["24310cc9-1afc-3316-80e1-60586010e6cf","6d1b0d35-dde5-1a58-c6f9-13fdc5deb7d2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Become part of the BLUE ANGELS TEAM; try the aerobatic simulator licensed by the U.S. Navy!\r\n\r\nExperience flight at 400 mph just 18 inches from your partner’s wing and face the challenge of official maneuvers aboard F/A-18 fighter jets and a C-130 transport aircraft. An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level.

While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6J4V7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"HorseWorld 3D FREE: My Riding Horse","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13898.13510798886744772.0a101abe-2683-4d2e-9fef-79a01ac71281.45e04446-049a-4c09-a79c-d4a6f6c2fad7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5019.13510798886744772.01239497-6373-4e3b-be33-e0affc0f8e08.e99655af-da09-4516-9bd7-fcbf7f126a53","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39604.13510798886744772.d6952a46-8cfe-4f5e-bc90-bec9a86d71d7.8c58f5a1-7c49-4564-bde2-6ca76817e9ac","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6744.13510798886744772.7d135760-857b-4ed5-934c-867cad4b262c.4c27e6a9-fb23-4a49-9246-ef0842afd2a3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"101","PackageFamilyNames":["Tivola.HorseWorld3DMyRidingHorse_znpcaja5jk6zj"],"ContentIds":["62d284e0-4bf6-a846-9ffc-a10036284add","f914bab3-7773-d7dd-7c04-8fe8c0c401db"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A dream come true!

That's where you come in.\n\nTacoma is a narrative adventure set aboard a high-tech space station in the year 2088. As you go about your mission, you'll explore every detail of how the station's crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.\n\nAt the heart of Tacoma is the facility's digital surveillance system, which has captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew's life on the station. As you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You'll use your ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing the multi-layered narrative as you explore.\n\nTacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling players deeper into the narrative than ever before.\n\nFeatures:\n\n·\tA Richly Layered Story Experience: Six crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships, experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.\n\n·\tA Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System: In each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine, and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes' chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.\n\n·\tA Deeply Interactive Gameworld: Explore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously exploring extensive records of the crew's digital communications and personal thoughts. Every facet of the crew's experience on Tacoma is part of your investigation.\n\n·\tA Vision of the Future: Experience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that depicts humanity's expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond.

Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realize your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system!\r\n\r\nAvailable ingame: SlopeMania!\r\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes!
